RanRan
======

alpha version

RanRan is a [YUI][] module that provides a JavaScript editor widget, and the means to run
the source code in a [web worker][] sandbox.

The editor itself is a YUI wrapper for the [Ace][] editor, but RanRan extends this
by presenting the editor in a YUI Panel which can be dragged, resized, and so on.

This work will be presented as part of the final project for an MSc in
e-Learning Technology.
